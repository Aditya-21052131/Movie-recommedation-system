Project Management Plan: Movie Recommendation System using an algorithm which combines
the features of KNN and Matrix Factorization with IMDB Dataset.

1. Project Objectives
Develop a movie recommendation system using KNN and Matrix Factorization algorithms.
Train and evaluate the performance of both algorithms on the IMDB dataset.
Compare the performance of both algorithms and recommend the best approach for deployment.
Combine both the algorithms and develop a better and more efficient  approach.
Design and implement a user interface for the recommendation system.

2.Project Scope
This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system with offline training and recommendation generation.
Real-time recommendations and integration with a specific platform are not included in this scope.

3. Project Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the implementation of KNN and Matrix Factorization algorithms for movie recommendation.
Performance evaluation report comparing the accuracy and recommendation quality of both algorithms as well as the combined algorithm.
A basic user interface (e.g., web application) showcasing the recommendation functionality.
Project documentation including this plan, code comments, and performance reports.

4.Project Schedule:
Milestones:
Data acquisition, exploration, and cleaning.
Feature engineering and pre-processing for both algorithms. 
KNN model implementation, training, and evaluation. 
Matrix Factorization model implementation, training, and evaluation. 
Performance comparison and algorithm selection. 
User interface design and implementation. 
Testing, documentation, and finalization.
Functional KNN model with evaluation report.
Functional Matrix Factorization model with evaluation report.
Selection of the recommended algorithm for deployment
Functional user interface prototype.
Finalized project deliverables and documentation

5.Project Resources:
Software: Python IDE (Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm), web development framework(HTML,CSS & JAVASCRIPT) for UI.
Data: IMDB dataset.

6.Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

Risk: Data sparsity and cold start problem impacting recommendation accuracy. 
Mitigation: Implement ensemble methods or hybrid approaches combining KNN and Matrix Factorization.
Risk: Performance differences between algorithms making selection difficult. 
Mitigation: Define clear evaluation metrics and conduct thorough comparison based on user needs and system goals. 
Risk: User interface development exceeding time or resource constraints. 
Mitigation: Start with a simple prototype and prioritize core functionalities for initial release.
